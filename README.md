# Event logger library with support for multiple persistence strategies (back-end support)
Event logger is a PHP based event logger library that makes it easy to collect and query events in your web application based on user or system actions.

With event logger you can:

- collect any kind of statistical data such as number of clicks for a certain url, page views, conversions or any kind of user generated action for your web application, API or mobile application
- collect and store human readable event logs such as: "Bob smith updated his email address on 12th January, 2015 at 12:30AM"
- collect and store human readable user notifications such as: "Bob Smith sent you a message on 12th January, 2015 at 12:30AM"
- collect and store system events, either human readable or not
- and any other sort of event logging your imagination allows you to come up with
